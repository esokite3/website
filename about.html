        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I am a second year computer science student at UC San Diego. I went to a performing arts middle school
            and was in the visual arts academy in high school. Why the pivot to computer science? I have always
            been enthusiastic about STEM subjects, and when my brother took interest in tech, I decided to give it
            a try. I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersive Program in 2022 where I felt as though 
            working with CSS closely resembled art. I hope to explore the intersection of technology and the arts 
            through my work in CS.</p>

        <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <h3 class="experiencetitle">Girls Who Code Summer Immersive Program</h3>
        <p>Learned the fundamentals of website development from wireframing to programming.
            Made a basic portfolio, Buzzfeed-style quiz, and a website about a societal concern.</p>
